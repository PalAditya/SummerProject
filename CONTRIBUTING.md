1. Everyone is welcome to contribute here. All that is necessary is a basic knowledge of Android.
2. Please create a new class if you wish to propose any changes to the linear regression model.
3. In continuation to point 2, any such changes must be supported by a convincing error analysis and source data set for your model.
The code, if wrriiten in Python/MATLAB, can be mailed separately to me.
4. If you wish to integrate TensorFlow, ensure the RAM consumption is not too high after that.
5. Any changes to the layout is whole-heartedly welcome. Just accompany a screenshot of the new, better layout to get it approved :)
